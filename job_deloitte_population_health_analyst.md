# Deloitte - Population Health Analyst Analysis

**Date Reviewed:** September 5, 2025
**Job ID:** 309971
**Company:** Deloitte Consulting LLP
**Position:** Population Health Analyst (Project Delivery Senior Analyst - AI & Engineering)
**Location:** Multiple Locations
**Salary:** $110,000 - $150,000

## Position Summary
This role is part of the Project Delivery Talent Model (PDM) for long-term, onsite client service delivery focused on Epic EHR system implementation and support.

## QUALIFICATION MISMATCH - NOT SUITABLE FOR HANNAH KIM

### Disqualifying Requirements:
- **Epic Ambulatory and Healthy Planet certifications REQUIRED** ❌
- **2+ years of recent Epic experience REQUIRED** ❌ 
- **Computer Science/IT background preferred** ❌

### Hannah Kim's Background:
- ✅ Bachelor's degree (BS in Public Health Science)
- ❌ No Epic certifications
- ❌ No Epic-specific experience (general EHR experience only)
- ❌ Public Health Science background, not Computer Science/IT

## Position Requirements Analysis:
**Required:**
- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, IT, Computer Engineering, or related IT discipline
- 2+ years recent Epic Ambulatory/Healthy Planet experience
- Current Epic Ambulatory and Healthy Planet certifications
- Experience in Epic application build, go-live, implementation, workflows, troubleshooting
- Travel 10%

**Job Responsibilities:**
- Build and configure Epic Population module enhancements
- Work within Epic system architecture
- Technical Epic system support and maintenance

## Why This Position Doesn't Match:
Despite the title "Population Health Analyst," this is actually an **Epic EHR Technical Analyst** role requiring specific Epic system certifications and technical implementation experience. The "population health" aspect refers to Epic's Population Health module, not traditional public health analysis work.

## Recommendation:
Look for traditional population health analyst roles in government agencies, public health departments, or healthcare organizations that focus on:
- Epidemiological analysis
- Public health data analysis  
- Community health assessment
- Health policy analysis
- Disease surveillance

These would better match Hannah's BS in Public Health Science and research background.
